<h1>Top Courses App</h1>
This is my first API fetched Top Courses app which uses both inhouse data as well data called from the web using GET command and then renders it into the simple and minimalistic UI.
<br>
Along with it, if offers filteration based on the genre of your course and helps you in finding your course faster
<br>
This is the complete UI of the code:

And this is the component hierarichy and the complete flow of data from one component to another as well from API's to components:
